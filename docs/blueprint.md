## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A calming blue (#64B5F6) to evoke trust and intelligence.  This choice uses blue to reinforce the association with the AI provider itself.
- Background color: Light gray (#F0F4F8) to ensure readability and reduce eye strain in prolonged use. This light value complements the light color scheme, creating a harmonious, neutral backdrop that keeps focus on the content.
- Accent color: A subtle purple (#9575CD) used for interactive elements like buttons and links, providing a gentle contrast. The subtle use of purple, a color closely analogous to blue, conveys creativity and problem solving.
- Use a clear, sans-serif font like Open Sans or Lato for the chat text to ensure readability.
- Use simple, outlined icons for common actions like sending messages or clearing the chat.
- Maintain a clean, spacious layout with a clear separation between user input and chat display areas.
